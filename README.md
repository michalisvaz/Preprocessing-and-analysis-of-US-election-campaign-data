# Analysis-of-2016-US-election-campaigns

This is a simple analysis (after some necessary preprocessing) of the 2016 United States presidential election. It was done as the first project for the course "Applied Machine Learning" of Management Science and Technology Department of AUEB.

During this project I gainned some experience using pandas for data preprocessing and more complex operations on data and experimented with the use of matplotlib to visualize information.

The data used in this project can be found [here](https://www.fec.gov/data/browse-data/?tab=bulk-data).
